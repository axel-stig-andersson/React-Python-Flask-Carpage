# React-Python-Flask-Carpage
Built a react typescript application with python backend (flask app), with full integration through an API written by myself. Small scale project, but some good features in requesthandling, access-controll, and filtering/querying!

SETUP FOR THE BACKEND 

  - Make sure to install flask, flask_sqlalchemy and flask_cors using pip.
  - Create a virtual environment in the server folder! 
  - Run the script in the server folder to configurate the app and create the database.


SETUP FOR THE FRONTEND 

  - use npm to install react router DOM, MUI(With types), and recoil. read the documentation for syntax. 
  - Customize the HOST variable in the API if you run the database on a different URL.
